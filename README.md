### Phone-Based Loyalty System
Overview
This project is a lightweight, phone-number-based loyalty tracking system designed for local salons, barbershops, and eateries. The goal is to help small businesses retain customers by rewarding repeat visits — without needing users to download an app or carry loyalty cards.

### Problem Statement
Many small businesses struggle to retain customers due to outdated or inconvenient loyalty systems (e.g., paper punch cards or app downloads). These methods are often ignored, forgotten, or simply ineffective.

### Our Solution
A streamlined, app-less loyalty system that:

Tracks visits using customers’ phone numbers.

Automatically rewards frequent visits.

Allows business owners to manage loyalty incentives easily.

Runs on modern, low-code tools for quick deployment.

### Tech Stack
Backend:

Supabase (authentication and database)

Bolt.new or Lovable.dev (API documentation and deployment)

Frontend:

MGX (UI builder)

Rork.app (optional prototype)

AI Tools:

Claude.ai (prompt generation)

Cursor AI (code suggestions and debugging)

Features
Phone number login (via Supabase)

Visit tracking and reward logic

Simple user interface for check-in

Business dashboard (optional)

AI-generated copy and content assistance
